<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Prana!</p>

<p>I'am still learrning how to code, an my coding skill is still trash atm. I'm hoping, i will improvise my self and be good at it.</p>

<p>I'm still catching my interest about coding things. I need some kind of motivation but it doesn't work, because of my condition that i'm still allowed to be laazy ass and being not productive. I hate when i have the right about it. I just need a hard slap to snap back to reality.</p>
